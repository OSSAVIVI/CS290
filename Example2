The other requirement for this lab is below:

The address where we can access Node on Engineering Servers.
This will be an URL in the form of http://flipX.engr.oregonstate.edu:YYYY, 
where flipX should be flip1, flip2, or flip3, and YYYY is the port number you choose, 
for example, 5678.
After following all the steps,  
once you go to view the webpage flipX.engr.oregonstate.edu:YYYY, 
the page displays "MySql results...", 
that means your link is working and the forever process is up.

My address where you can access my Node on Engineering Servers is below:
http://flip3.engr.oregonstate.edu:8811

I chose port number 8811 because it is a permutation of the last 4 of my student ID number (1881), 
which is what the instructions suggested I do. I will upload this to Canvas as a text document in addition to the
link to this repository, https://github.com/OSSAVIVI/CS290, so it will look like the text below when I
submit my assignment:

http://flip3.engr.oregonstate.edu:8811
