This is an example file used to fulfill the requirements 
below from the link here: https://oregonstate.instructure.com/courses/1729315/assignments/7605009?module_item_id=18834633


Create a GitHub repository and add some contents to it.

* A link to your GitHub repository
      - Link here: https://github.com/OSSAVIVI/CS290
* This repository should have at least 2 files (any file type or content works) added to it.
      - If you set your repository as public, everyone can access it.  
      - If you set it as private, please add OSU-CS290-Tester as a collaborator 
       (you do not need to wait for the response from the Collaborator) so 
       TAs can use the tester account to check your repository for grading.
              * I have set mine up as public for convenience
